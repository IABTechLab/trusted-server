## Config store keys

Config store name: **`trusted_server_config`** (Fastly service config store)

| Key                    | Type                 | Effect                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edgezero_enabled`     | `"true"` / `"false"` | Master on/off switch. Set `"false"` to disable EdgeZero entirely, regardless of rollout_pct.                                                          |
| `edgezero_rollout_pct` | `"0"` – `"100"`      | Percentage of traffic (by client IP bucket) routed to EdgeZero. Only read when `edgezero_enabled = "true"`. Key absent = `"0"` (fail safe to legacy). |

**Routing logic:** `fnv1a_bucket(client_ip) < edgezero_rollout_pct` → EdgeZero, else legacy.
Same client IP always gets the same bucket — routing is sticky per client IP (not per
user; a user whose IP changes, e.g. mobile roaming or ISP reassignment, may re-bucket and
switch paths, and could observe inconsistent identity if the two paths differ in EC handling).

### Safe defaults / failure modes

| Condition                                           | Effective behaviour    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Config store unreachable                            | All legacy             |
| `edgezero_enabled` unreadable                       | All legacy             |
| `edgezero_rollout_pct` absent (but enabled=true)    | All legacy (fail safe) |
| `edgezero_rollout_pct` invalid (non-integer, > 100) | All legacy             |
| `edgezero_rollout_pct = "0"`                        | All legacy (rollback)  |

> **Note:** Every non-explicit state fails safe to legacy — an absent, invalid, or unreadable
> `edgezero_rollout_pct` all route 100% to the legacy path, so deleting the key can never trigger
> a cutover. To roll out, set an explicit percentage; to pause or roll back, set `"0"`.

## Canary progression

> **Pre-condition:** All Phase 5 verification gates (PR18) passed.

### Pre-flight activation

Before advancing any stage, activate the canary switch:

1. Confirm `edgezero_rollout_pct = "0"` (or absent — both fail safe to legacy) in the
   production config store. Setting it explicitly to `"0"` documents intent.
2. Set `edgezero_enabled = "true"` in the production config store.
3. Confirm the flag is live and all traffic is still on the legacy path.
   `rollout_pct = "0"` deterministically short-circuits every request to the
   legacy path (`should_route_to_edgezero` in the Fastly entry point), so all-legacy
   is guaranteed by the config value rather than observed per request: confirm the
   config-store values are applied and that error rate, p95 latency, and timeout
   rate hold at baseline. There is no production per-branch route signal to tail
   (see [Monitoring](#monitoring)); the `routing request through legacy path
(rollout_pct=0)` line is emitted at `debug!`, so it surfaces only in local
   Viceroy runs started with `EDGEZERO_LOG_LEVEL=debug` (the logger defaults to
   `Info`, which suppresses it).

### Stage 1 — 1%

1. Set `edgezero_rollout_pct = "1"` in the production config store.
2. Hold **30 minutes**.
3. Check pass/fail thresholds (see below).
4. If all green → advance to Stage 2. If any threshold breached → rollback.

### Stage 2 — 10%

1. Set `edgezero_rollout_pct = "10"`.
2. Hold **2 hours** (same time-of-day window as the 7-day baseline).
3. Check pass/fail thresholds.
4. If all green → advance to Stage 3. If any threshold breached → rollback.

### Stage 3 — 50%

1. Set `edgezero_rollout_pct = "50"`.
2. Hold **24 hours**.
3. Check pass/fail thresholds. Pay particular attention to auction win-rate.
4. If all green → advance to Stage 4. If any threshold breached → rollback.

### Stage 4 — 100% (full cutover)

1. Set `edgezero_rollout_pct = "100"`.
2. Hold **48 hours** before decommissioning the legacy entry point.
3. Confirm zero regressions across all metrics.
4. Open legacy cleanup PR (removes `legacy_main()` and flag plumbing, see issue #495).

## Pass/fail thresholds

**Baseline definition:** 7-day rolling average from production Fastly service
metrics, sampled from the same time-of-day window as the canary observation
period (to account for diurnal traffic patterns).

| Metric           | Threshold                | Action if breached                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Error rate (5xx) | > 0.1% above baseline    | **Immediate rollback**                 |
| p95 latency      | > 15% above baseline     | Hold; rollback if no fix within 1 hour |
| Auction win-rate | > 1% delta from baseline | Hold; investigate                      |
| Timeout rate     | > 2× baseline            | **Immediate rollback**                 |

> **Note on p95 threshold:** The spec §Cutover paragraph mentions ±10% as the Stage 2 hold-point
> criterion; the threshold table at §Pass/fail thresholds says 15%. These two values are
> inconsistent in the spec. This runbook adopts the threshold table (15%) as the governing
> number because it applies uniformly across all stages. If ops adopts a stricter 10% target
> at Stage 2, update this table accordingly.

## Rollback procedure

Rollback is **immediate, no deploy required**.

1. Set `edgezero_rollout_pct = "0"` in the production config store.
   Traffic shifts back to legacy within a few seconds as the config store propagates
   across edge PoPs; each Wasm instance picks up the change on its next request.
2. Optionally set `edgezero_enabled = "false"` as belt-and-suspenders.
3. Investigate root cause before re-advancing the canary.
4. Keep the legacy entry point (`legacy_main()`) available until at least one
   full release cycle after reaching 100% with zero regressions.

## Monitoring

> **There is no production signal that splits traffic by EdgeZero-vs-legacy
> branch yet.** The per-request route decision is emitted only at `log::debug!`
> (`should_route_to_edgezero` in the Fastly entry point), and the Fastly logger
> defaults to `Info` (`logging::init_logger`), so these lines do not reach the
> production log endpoint — production Fastly Compute does not surface the
> `EDGEZERO_LOG_LEVEL` override that would raise the level. They can be made
> visible only in local Viceroy runs that set `EDGEZERO_LOG_LEVEL=debug`. No
> `x-edgezero-path` response-path marker exists (deferred
> follow-up), and no Fastly real-time-stats traffic split is configured for this
> decision. Until a production-safe per-branch signal is added, canary
> verification relies on aggregate service metrics moving as expected when
> `rollout_pct` is stepped — not on per-request branch attribution.

Fastly real-time stats dashboard — aggregate service signals (not split by
branch). Watch each as `rollout_pct` is increased stage by stage; a regression
that appears and tracks the rollout steps implicates the EdgeZero branch:

- **Error rate:** `5xx / total_requests` by edge PoP
- **Latency p95:** service-wide
- **Auction win-rate:** downstream SSP reporting, compare same-day prior week
- **Timeout rate:** `504 / total_requests`

> For local pre-production validation under Viceroy, start the simulator with
> `EDGEZERO_LOG_LEVEL=debug` (the logger defaults to `Info`, which suppresses
> these lines) — for example `EDGEZERO_LOG_LEVEL=debug fastly compute serve`.
> The route-decision log lines are then:
>
> - `routing request through EdgeZero path (bucket=N, rollout_pct=M)` — partial-stage canary traffic.
> - `routing request through legacy path (bucket=N, rollout_pct=M)` — partial-stage legacy traffic.
> - At the degenerate values the bucket is not computed:
>   `routing request through legacy path (rollout_pct=0)` (full rollback) and
>   `routing request through EdgeZero path (rollout_pct=100)` (full cutover).
